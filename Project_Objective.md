#   Project Objective

##  Introduction:

1. Singapore - total land area of approximately 728.6 square kilometers (281.3 square miles)
2. Singapore's population is approximately 5.92 million
3. Around 7.54 million daily journeys were made using public transport as of 2022
4. it’s estimated that over 60-70% of the population uses transport-related apps for real-time bus or MRT timings, route planning, or ride-hailing services.

- Nearly 80% of Singapore's population relies on public transport.
- Transportation is the essential tool for everyone

##  Craft a problem statement
How might we make it convenient and easy for public transport users in order to reach home or meeting locations as fast as possible.

## Craft a business narrative around your problem statement
What is the problem?
- I rush to bus stop but end up spend lots of time waiting for the bus when I could have done something else first with that waiting time.

Why is it worth solving (what is the business impact if you don’t solve it)?
- Allow people to plan and complete more things they want to do with that waiting time
- Allow people to get home or get to meeting places on time

How does success look like? (eg. Metrics)
- User Reviews

## Challenges encountered during the project making

# Project title: Bus Tracking App
  - We must think of a project name
  - Make a "User Stories" presentation in PowerPoint or Google Slide (for presentation use and come out the ideas to structure our project)
  - Plan and Structure for the project UI / UX (color/ how the app looks and etc...)
  - Organise the task and share with each other to working on the modules (Based on the knowledges we learn)
  - Compile all the module into a production app
  - Unit and UAT Testing
  - Public the production code on Website (using Netlify or .... )
